We propose a method to reduce this cost. Our method encodes quantized updates with an appropriate universal code, taking into account their empirical distribution. Because quantization introduces error, we select quantization levels by optimizing for the desired trade-off in average total bitrate and gradient distortion. We demonstrate empirically that in spite of the non-i.i.d. nature of federated learning, the rate–distortion frontier is consistent across datasets, optimizers, clients and training rounds, and within each setting, distortion reliably predicts model performance. This allows for a remarkably simple compression scheme that is near-optimal in many use cases, and outperforms TOP-K, DRIVE, 3LC and QSGD on the Stack Overflow next-word prediction benchmark.","tags":null,"title":"Optimizing the Communication-Accuracy Trade-off in Federated Learning with Rate-Distortion Theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicole Elyse Mitchell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"b8306bd723615c395c4b43b2dcca4dad","permalink":"https://nicolemitchell.github.io/publication/mitchell-2020/","publishdate":"2022-03-25T20:35:05.804632Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mitchell-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Drug metabolism studies are a critical component of the drug design process. Metabolism of some drugs can lead to diminished therapeutic efficacy or even toxicity. The stability of a drug is expressed by the atoms, called Sites of Metabolism (SOMs), which undergo structural changes when that drug interacts with a metabolizing enzyme. Computationally predicting these metabolically labile atoms early on in the drug development process will enable pharmaceutical chemists to design molecules with favorable metabolic properties.  A number of in silico methods have been developed for identifying SOMs, with a recent focus on machine learning due to its computational efficiency over structural modeling. Machine learning techniques classify atoms as SOMs based on feature vector representations. Existing approaches rely upon expert knowledge and often expensive experiments to engineer fixed atom descriptors with extensive sets of experimentally-derived attributes. However, models based upon learned instead of fixed representations have proven promising in other chemoinformatics tasks.  Seeing molecules as attributed graphs, where atoms correspond to nodes and bonds correspond to edges, the SOM prediction problem can be formulated as a node classification task. We compare two methods of extracting node features from molecular graphs: a standard fingerprint generation strategy used by existing SOM prediction methods, which constructs task-agnostic node descriptors, and an unexplored approach based on a graph convolutional neural network, which learns taskspecific node encodings. Both methods take into account the node attributes and graph connectivity to generate descriptive atom representations. We experiment with parameters that can influence the performance of both feature extraction methods on a dataset commonly used in the literature for predicting SOMs.  Despite the fact that the graph convolution approach requires more data and has more parameters to tune, we have achieved comparable performance between the two methods. Given enough data, we believe the graph convolution approach may reliably achieve improved performance over the fingerprint generation strategy. Our results indicate that the graph convolution approach can outperform the fixed fingerprint generation strategy when starting from molecular graphs that are not initialized with rich electro-chemical properties, demonstrating how learned representations could replace the need for expert-derived features for SOM prediction. Our results also illustrate the importance of tuning the feature extraction method to the metabolizing enzyme of interest.","tags":null,"title":"Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Sites of Metabolism in Drugs: Exploring Feature Extraction Methods on Molecular Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eleni Litsa","Nicole Mitchell","Lydia E Kavraki"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"3ea1aeedc25022bbeddf66d3aa7ed913","permalink":"https://nicolemitchell.github.io/publication/keckrdsci-2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-23T20:14:27.041434Z","relpermalink":"/publication/keckrdsci-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["graph nets","drug metabolism"],"title":"Applying Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Drug Metabolism Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Didier Devaurs","Dinler A Antunes","Sarah Hall-Swan","Nicole Mitchell","Mark Moll","Gregory Lizée","Lydia E Kavraki"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"748e53fd97b58ceba6a862960e1dff47","permalink":"https://nicolemitchell.github.io/publication/devaurs-2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-23T20:14:27.039959Z","relpermalink":"/publication/devaurs-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Docking large ligands, and especially peptides, to protein receptors is still considered a challenge in computational structural biology. Besides the issue of accurately scoring the binding modes of a protein-ligand complex produced by a molecular docking tool, the conformational sampling of a large ligand is also often considered a challenge because of its underlying combinatorial complexity. In this study, we evaluate the impact of using parallelized and incremental paradigms on the accuracy and performance of conformational sampling when docking large ligands. We use ﬁve datasets of protein-ligand complexes involving ligands that could not be accurately docked by classical protein-ligand docking tools in previous similar studies.  Results: Our computational evaluation shows that simply increasing the amount of conformational sampling performed by a protein-ligand docking tool, such as Vina, by running it for longer is rarely beneﬁcial. Instead, it is more eﬃcient and advantageous to run several short instances of this docking tool in parallel and group their results together, in a straightforward parallelized docking protocol. Even greater accuracy and eﬃciency are achieved by our parallelized incremental meta-docking tool, DINC, showing the additional beneﬁts of its incremental paradigm. Using DINC, we could accurately reproduce the vast majority of the protein-ligand complexes we considered.  Conclusions: Our study suggests that, even when trying to dock large ligands to proteins, the conformational sampling of the ligand should no longer be considered an issue, as simple docking protocols using existing tools can solve it. Therefore, scoring should currently be regarded as the biggest unmet challenge in molecular docking.
